- Analysis is now performed on a deeper level, there are 2 key metrics: completion rate and sucess rate:
Completion rate refers to the percentage of Blue Prism instances that are completed or properly handle a business exception in relation to the total number of Blue Prism instances (Blue Prism sucess rate)
Sucess rate is a business facing sucess metric, that measures sucess in terms of requests. A request is a loan that is triggered for a Blue Prism process to pick up, and if this request is completed within the established criteria - 3 retries without human intervention -, then it is considered a completion (Encompass sucess rate)

- Completion rate takes a business exceptions as a success since the path is handled accordingly.
